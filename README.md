# 1.11 Update!
I've changed this up some to use maven instead of gradle, so it looks a lot different from the original but is actually mostly the same. Just had to change some things to make it work with 1.11! :D

Also fixed the bug with the zombie eggs not working in v1_8_R3.

# UltraCosmetics
UltraCosmetics is a Spigot 1.8.8/1.9.x/1.10 plugin which adds cool cosmetics for your server hub.

You must use Spigot, and not CraftBukkit for this plugin!

THE (“UltraCosmetics”) SOURCE IS PROVIDED AS IS AT NO MONETARY COST FOR PERSONAL USE ONLY. ANY COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION/USE OF THE (“UltraCosmetics”) SOURCE IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED.

Adding a new Cosmetics is really simple.
Create your GadgetType, PetType, etc.. In the enum file located in the corresponding cosmetic package.

Create the file extending Gadget/Pet/etc... and make your gadget. (you can have a look to other gadgets if you don't
know how to do)

Done! :)
